# TTRPG Guide

An apples-to-apples comparison chart for tabletop RPGs.

## Criteria

RPGs should only be included if they are:

- Not defunct (still actively sold and promoted)
- Well known (repeatedly mentioned in online conversation, and not by sockpuppet accounts)

## FAQ

#### Why is *Apocalypse World* used as the "Price of Entry" for Powered by the Apocalypse?

"Powered by the Apocalypse" covers a very diverse set of RPGs in reality, and an even more diverse set in theory. But in order for this chart to compare apples to apples, there has to be a price point and some kind of "core book." *Apocalypse World* is the RPG that started the PbtA phenomenon and the only book that could be called canonical, so it's the only reasonable choice.

#### Why is (GAME) listed as (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) crunch? It's actually (LOWER/HIGHER).

Crunch can be subjective. For each game, rather than making the judgment call on my own, I found forum and social media threads on the topic and did my best to gather some kind of consensus. Sometimes there's a lot of dissent among the player base and that's okay! But whenever someone said "yes, the system has a lot of rules, but you can play without most of them," I ignored that. The only fair way to compare systems is the way they were designed (RAW).

It's still possible I screwed something up. If you have in-depth experience with two of the RPGs on the list and believe they're misrepresented relative to each other, [file an issue](https://github.com/isaaclyman/ttrpg-guide/issues/new/choose) and let me know.

#### Why are (GAME) and (GAME) listed under the same system? They're nothing alike.

This is a guide to tabletop *systems*, not games. Granted, there's significant diversity within some systems, especially loosely-defined ones like PbtA. But in my opinion, it's still useful information to group PbtA games together, and doing so helps keep the project manageable.

- Discord community links
- System type (simulationist, narrative, gamist, OSR)

Other ideas:

- Add a footnote to Apocalypse World - it's not really a "core" rulebook, and each PbtA game stands on its own
